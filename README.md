# ROAR - An NLP/Speech Processing Toolkit for Indic Languages

## Introduction

ROAR is a toolkit for Indic languages that provides a unified interface for various NLP and Speech Processing tasks. It is built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (WIP). It is based on a lean fork of Nvidia's [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) toolkit. Majorly targeting Text-to-Speech Synthesis ROAR aims to streamline developer workflow from implementing new models with pre-implemented modularized functions that can be re-used across projects/models.
